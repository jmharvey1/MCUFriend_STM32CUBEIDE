Decoder_JLCPCBfiles_2022-09-19.zip May be used to submit an order to fabricate a "motherboard" to host the blackpill, display, and other related parts, from JLCPCB.

Use "F411CWDecoder_202nnnnn.bin" and STM's SMT32CubeProgrammer to "flash" the program to your Blackpill MPU. Alternatively compile the scouce code using files found in F411CWDecoder__202nnnnn.zip and STM's STM32CubeIDE (ver 1.9.0). Instructions for both methods can be found in the "Build Docs" folder of this repository.

Other files found in this folder are fairly self-explanatory
