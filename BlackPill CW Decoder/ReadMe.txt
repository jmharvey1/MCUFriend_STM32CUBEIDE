Decoder_JLCPCBfiles_2022-09-19.zip May be used to submit an order to fabricate a "motherboard" to host the blackpill, display, and other related parts, from JLCPCB

Use "F411CWDecoder.bin" and STM's SMT32CubeProgrammer to "flash" the program to your Blackpill MPU. Alternatively compile the scouce code using files found in F411CWDecoder__20221014.zip and STM's STM32CubeIDE (ver 1.9.0)

Other files found in this folder are fairly self-explanatory
