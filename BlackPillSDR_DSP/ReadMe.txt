for an explanation of what & how this set of files is used.

Use "BlackPillSDR01_.... .bin" and STM's SMT32CubeProgrammer to "flash" the program to your Blackpill MPU. Alternatively compile the scouce code using files found in BlackPillSDR01_.... .zip and STM's STM32CubeIDE (ver 1.9.0). Instructions for both methods can be found in the "Build Docs" folder of this repository.
