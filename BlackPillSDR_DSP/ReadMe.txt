for an explanation of what & how this set of files is used.

Use "BlackPillSDR01_.... .bin" and STM's SMT32CubeProgrammer to "flash" the program to your Blackpill MPU. Alternatively compile the scouce code using files found in BlackPillSDR01_.... .zip and STM's STM32CubeIDE (ver 1.9.0). Instructions for both methods can be found in the "Build Docs" folder of this repository.
Use "BlackPillSDR_2022-04-22.zip" if you want a PC board service, like JLCPCB, to fabricate the mother board for this project. Note the rail to rail pin spacing for the STM32F411 is slightly undersized, to support an solderless interference fit. If a more secure connection is desired, fit the male & female headers to the F411, before soldering the motherboard headers.
